## Lab 1

Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the
following array operations.
a) Creating an array of N Integer Elements
b) Display of array Elements with Suitable Headings
c) Inserting an Element (ELEM) at a given valid Position (POS)
d) Deleting an Element at a given valid Position(POS)
e) Exit.
Support the program with functions for each of the above
operations.

## Lab 2

Define an EMPLOYEE structure with members Emp_name, Emp-id,
Dept-name and Salary. Read and display data of N employees.

Employees may belong to different departments. Write a function
to find the total salary of employees of a specified department.
Use the concept of pointer to structure and allocate the memory
dynamically to EMPLOYEE instances.

## Lab 3

Write a c program to implement STACK using array
STACK of Integers (Array Implementation of Stack with maximum
size MAX)
a) Push an Element on to Stack
b) Pop an Element from Stack
c) Demonstrate how Stack can be used to check Palindrome
d) Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations on Stack
e) Display the status of Stack
f) Exit
Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the
above operations
