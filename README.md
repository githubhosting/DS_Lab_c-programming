# Data Structure Lab - C Programming

This repository contains the programs for the Data Structure Lab in C Programming.

## Lab 1

Design, Develop and Implement a menu driven Program in C for the
following array operations.

- a.Creating an array of N Integer Elements
- b.Display of array Elements with Suitable Headings
- c.Inserting an Element (ELEM) at a given valid Position (POS)
- d.Deleting an Element at a given valid Position(POS)
- e.Exit.
Support the program with functions for each of the above
operations.

## Lab 2

Define an EMPLOYEE structure with members Emp_name, Emp-id,
Dept-name and Salary. Read and display data of N employees.

Employees may belong to different departments. Write a function
to find the total salary of employees of a specified department.
Use the concept of pointer to structure and allocate the memory
dynamically to EMPLOYEE instances.

## Lab 3

Write a c program to implement STACK using array
STACK of Integers (Array Implementation of Stack with maximum
size MAX)

- a.Push an Element on to Stack
- b.Pop an Element from Stack
- c.Demonstrate how Stack can be used to check Palindrome
- d.Demonstrate Overflow and Underflow situations on Stack
- e.Display the status of Stack
- f.Exit
Support the program with appropriate functions for each of the
above operations

## Lab 4

Enter the infix expression to convert to postfix expression
Write a C program to convert and print a given valid parenthesized
infix arithmetic expression to postfix expression. The expression
consists of single-character operands and binary operators + - * /.
Apply the concept of stack data structure to solve this problem.

## Lab 5

C Program to evaluate value of a postfix expression using stack

## Lab 6

Write recursive functions for the following and demonstrate their use.

- a.Binary Search
- b.Tower of Hanoi problem.

## Lab 7

Queue in Data Structure | Queue implementation using array in C Programming

## Lab 8

Write a C program to simulate the working of a circular Queue of
integers. Represent circular queue element as a structure and use
array of structures as your implementation method. Start and end of
the circular queue must be identified by an empty array element.

## Lab 9

Write a program to create a singly linked list that maintains a
list of names in alphabetical order. Implement the following
operations on the list.

- a.Insert a new name
- b.Delete a specified name

## Lab 10

Write a C program to maintain a stack of integers using linked implementation method.

## Lab 11

Write a C program to support the following operations on a doubly
linked list.

- a.Insert a new node to the left of the node whose key value is read
as an input.
- b.Delete a node with given data, if it is found otherwise display
appropriate error message.

## Lab 12

Write a C program

- a.To construct a binary tree of integers.
- b.To traverse the tree using inorder, preorder and postorder
traversal methods.
